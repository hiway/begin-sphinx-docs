How to document and share your knowledge with Sphinx
====================================================

Have you found yourself explaining the steps needed to perform a task
to a friend, a coworker or even a stranger on the Internet…
after you had already explained it to someone else?

It is time to document!


Why Write and Publish a How-To?
-------------------------------

- Distill and review your own understanding of the topic.
- Collect what you learned from many sources into one document.
- Save your own time next time you forget that one little detail.
- Help others catch up and become self-sufficient on the topic.
- If you are writing for people you work with,
  good docs help the entire team move ahead faster.

Why Sphinx?
-----------

- Sphinx is a full-fledged Open Source documentation system
  with many community-contributed extensions
  that take care of common needs when writing docs.
  We will explore a few in this tutorial.
- Use source-control tools such as git/github/bitbucket
  to work on the documents offline, merge changes from others,
  manage versions and more.
- Automatic spelling-check, hyperlink-validation and other checks.
- Publish to a website, as an ebook
  or with a bit of effort, even straight to PDF.
- Publish straight to github-pages or readthedocs.org for free.
