    How To Handle Everything?!
    ==========================

    Step 1. Observe.
    ----------------

    Before you do anything, observeâ€¦
    what do you have here?

    - What is happening?
    - What are the risks?
    - How much time do you have to resolve it?

    Step 2. Orient.
    ---------------

    Now orient yourself to grasp the situation.

    - What options do you have?
    - What are the constraints that must be met?
    - Who can you ask for help?
    - Who can give you a different perspective?

    Step 3. Decide.
    ---------------

    Decide on what you are about to do and why.

    Step 4. Act.
    ------------

    Make it so!

    Step 5. Repeat as necessary.
    ----------------------------

    - If the situation changes, adapt.
    - If the decision made before did not work, adapt.
    - If no further action required, do something else.
